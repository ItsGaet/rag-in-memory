    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Set your OpenAI API key:

    Open the `.env` file (create the file if it does not exist) and add your OpenAI API key:

    OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here
    ```

## How to Use It

1. Start the Streamlit application:

    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

2. Upload a PDF via the user interface.

3. After uploading the PDF, wait for the FAISS index to be created.

4. Ask a question about the content of the PDF and get an immediate answer!

## Examples of Use

### Uploading PDF
